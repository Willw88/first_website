<h1 style="text-align: center;"> My honda 250cc trail bike review</h1>
<p>This bike is a good bike all the way around, with few negatives. First the positives, the power of the is nothing compared to a competion dirtbike. The bike gives all skills and ages of riders a great bike for trails. The power complimented with the gearing makes for an enjoyable trail ride. The power won't cause the bike to do wheelies while climbimg a hill, but also has enough power that it won't get you stuck on a hill. The bikes air cooled motor always riders to enjoy their ride while not having to worry about busting a coolant line. The suspiension on this bike is softer then competion bikes and makes riding over rocks and bumps pretty smooth. Now the negatives, the bike is fuel injected so if the battery dies on the trails, well your screwed. You won't be able to pop start the bike like you would with a carbureted bike. There also is no kick starter on the bike so you once again have to rely on a good battery.   </p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"> My rating</h2>
<p2 sytle="text-align: center;">8/10 </p2>
